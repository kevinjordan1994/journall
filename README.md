# Journall

![Journall Image](https://github.com/kevinjordan1994/journall/blob/main/images/journall-image.PNG)

Journall is a CRUD application in which users can create and name journals and individual entries for those journals.
To get started, created an account by entering a username and password. Once you have an account you can start adding your own Journalls!

This app was made with Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I made if after spending a lot of time making React apps and I wanted to brush up on my DOM manipulation skills.
Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
